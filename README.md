About
-----

The MSX-EQ PSG Spectrolyzer is a simple cartridge that visualizes the spectrum of notes produced by a programmable sound generator such as the AY-3-8910 or YM2149 (PSG). The board is intended for installation in a standard MSX slot. The board reproduces the effect of measuring the signal level, in which each reproduced frequency (frequency range) corresponds to one of nine vertical LED indicators. After playing a note or frequency, the indicator fades out.
There are two cartridge versions:
1. On discrete LED elements, as simpler, but allowing for various color solutions
2. On indicator assemblies, the so-called "bars", mostly monochrome
The following color solutions are possible, which were tested by us and gave a good visual effect (other color solutions are also possible):
1. Single color LED assemblies in blue, red or green
2. Multi-color LED assemblies of blue with red or green with red (red indicators are placed on top)
